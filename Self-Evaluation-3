For this iteration, I believe for the server side setup I have mostly set up the directory correctly however for the node.js setup i am unsure how to have it work through github so unsure how to represent that.

EJS implementation I am still confused on how that works and how to use it in this assignment so I do not believe I will get points for this portion.

overall I have set up most that I could understand based on the inclass practices but still am confused on how to work it.
