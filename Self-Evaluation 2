For my self evaluation for this iteration, Due to mid-term due on the same day as the assignment, I could not achieve all the necessary requirements for this iteration as pointed out in the rubric.
For form Validations, I have most of the basics added where I could but have not had the time to format them the way I would like. Inline Event Handler I believe I achieved as well as Listener Approach.
Event Types could use more variaty than just 'click' but I do have plans to implement 'keydown' and 'onsubmit' if more time was given.
I was not able to add Validating forms to my webpage so I do not believe I will get any points from that.

Manipulate style section I do not believe I was able to do most of the tasks in this section so I dont believe I will get much points from this.

From the various JavaScript Fundamentals section I have some variables and use of conditionals and loops as well as functions so I believe I should get some points from this section.
