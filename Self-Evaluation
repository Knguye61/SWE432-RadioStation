Due to my busy schedule and 3 projects all due by or the day after this assignment's due date, as well as midterms on the same week,
this was the best I could pull together for this assignment. In regards to what points I should get, I am not too sure, however I can 
say that my code is definetly lacking in Advance HTML Elements & Attributes as well as the embedding of <audio> atleast at the time of me 
writing this self-evaluation.

From the CSS Basics: I do believe I have Styling with CSS done however Selectors & Specificity I am unsure so I dont believe I will get much
points from that

CSS Advanced Techniques: I am a mixed for this part because I do believe I used inline styles and external styles however im not sure if it was correct

Bonus points: I dont believe this was the best visualization even for me and would wish I had less on my plate so I could possibly focus more on this
however between work and 4 other classes I have not been able to fully focus my attention and have been falling behind.
